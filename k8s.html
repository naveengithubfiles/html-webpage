    How you deply application on kubernetes<br>
    How to expose application outside in k8 environment?<br>
    What is deployment and ReplicationSet in K8S ?<br>
    How I can modify nodePort to load balancer?<br>
    While upgrading to K8S 1.14 v to 1.16 . What are all actions you take ? How you can upgrade without impact the running applications ? And How do you achieve?<br>
    How do give secrets in encrypted format?<br>
